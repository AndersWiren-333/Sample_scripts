Wrote and tested subroutine fileTools::compress

It compresses a file into a .gz file, in a platform independent way.
Usage information has been added to Modules_and_functions.xlsx


Updated subroutine matrixTools::replace_matrix_chunk to terminate if the user enters the wrong dimensions of the area to be replaced.

Previously the columns to be deleted from a matrix were specified as 0, 1, 2 etc. Since perl can't accept zeros
as arguments for scripts or subroutines, '0' had to be specified as 'n'. Now column numbering starts at 1, so there
is no longer any need handle zeros as arguments. Usage information in Modules_and_functions.xlsx updated.
