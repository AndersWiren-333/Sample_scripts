Wrote and tested perl subroutine matrixTools::add_seq_lengths_to_matrix_from_fasta

It takes a matrix where each row represents a genomic feature and computes adds as a column the length of the sequences corresponding to
each feature (computed from a specified fasta file).
Usage information has been added to Scripts_and_functions.xlsx

Updated perl subroutine normalise::length_normalise_matrix

It now uses indexing of matrix columns starting at 1 (previously it started at 0, which is a number that can't be used
as an input parameter for scripts and subroutines).
